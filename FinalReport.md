## 3.	Tests

### 3.1 Front-end Test

**3.1.1** The front-end testing is completed using Jest, an open-source JavaScript testing framework from Facebook that automatically integrates all the testing tools required by developers such as assertions, JSDom, and coverage reports. It is an almost zero configuration testing framework。

**3.1.2** Test code example：

![image-test-front](FinalReport-Pictures/image-test-front.png)

**3.1.3** Test Coverage:

![image-test-front2](FinalReport-Pictures/image-test-front2.png)

### 3.2 Back-end Test

**3.2.1** backend use python's unittest to test, a classical test method can be implemented as follows

```python
def test_get_expense_by_id(self):
    # 发送 GET 请求并获取响应
    response = self.app.get('/api/expenses/1')
    # 验证状态码是否为 200
    assert response.status_code == 200
    # 获取响应数据
    data = response.get_json()
    # 验证数据内容
    assert 'error' not in data  # 没有错误信息表示成功
    assert isinstance(data, dict)  # 数据类型为字典
    assert 'expenseID' in data  # 包含 expenseID 字段
```

**3.2.2** test coverage rate 
use python's coverage to 
Using the Python library coverage to gather relevant information.
![image-test-backend](FinalReport-Pictures/img_1.png)
Due to the complexity of certain functions in server.py, 
such as generating charts or graphical representations 
in the frontend, achieving a high test coverage rate has 
been challenging. However, it should be noted that the 
majority of the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
operations have been covered by tests. These tests have 
proven to be immensely valuable during the development of 
our applications. While the coverage may not be exhaustive 
due to the specific nature of certain functionalities, the 
implemented tests have provided significant support and 
confidence in the overall robustness of the system


## 4.	Build



### Front-end Build (Vue.js):

1. Technology/Tools/Frameworks:

   - Node.js: JavaScript runtime used to execute build scripts and manage dependencies.
   - npm (Node Package Manager): Used to install and manage project dependencies.
   - Vue CLI (Command-Line Interface): A development tool for scaffolding and managing Vue.js projects.

2. Tasks executed in the build and final artifacts produced:

   - Installation of project dependencies: This includes Vue.js itself and any additional libraries or packages required by your project.

   - Compilation and bundling of front-end assets: The build process compiles Vue.js components, CSS styles, and other static assets into optimized and minified files.

   - Generation of production-ready artifacts: The final output typically includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that can be served by a web server.

   - ```shell
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```

3. Buildfile or related artifacts/scripts:

   - Vue CLI generates a configuration file called `vue.config.js` in project's root directory. This file can be customized to modify the build process, configure webpack, and handle other build-related tasks. 

   - Find more information about `vue.config.js` in the Vue CLI documentation: [Vue CLI Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

   - URL of  `vue.config.js` :https://github.com/skylynf/SUSTechACD/blob/main/vue.config.js

   - Part of Snapshot:

     >  ![image-20230530141327691](FinalReport-Pictures/image-20230530141327691.png)

   - The `package.json` file is a manifest file that contains metadata about your project and its dependencies. It is also used to define various scripts that can be executed using npm.

   - URL of `package.json` : https://github.com/skylynf/SUSTechACD/blob/main/vue.config.js

   - Part of Snapshot:

     >![image-20230530141136952](FinalReport-Pictures/image-20230530141136952.png)



### Back-end Build (Python Flask):

1. Technology/Tools/Frameworks:

   - Python: Programming language used for back-end development.
   - pip: Package installer for Python used to manage project dependencies.
   - Flask: Micro web framework for Python used to build the back-end server.

2. Tasks executed in the build and final artifacts produced:

   - Dependency installation: Installation of required Python packages, including Flask and any additional libraries.

   - Configuration and setup: The build process might involve setting up environment variables, configuring the database connection, and other initialization steps.

   - ```shell
     pip install
     python -m flask run
     ```

3. Buildfile or related artifacts/scripts:

   - In Python Flask projects, build scripts are typically not as standardized as in front-end frameworks. 





## 5.	Deployment

1. Introduce the containerization technology/tools/frameworks used in your project.

In our project, the containerization tools are Nginx and WSGI. This solution is small in size, easy to install, fast in response, easy to use, no additional modification to the code, and completely realize the front end and back end separation.

2. The script or related artifacts used for containerization. Briefly introduce how you assigned different services into different
containers.

For the frontend, when you run __npm run dev__, the vue code will run directly, while when you run __npm run build:prod__, the vue code will be transcribed into html/css/js and stored in the dist folder in the root directory, which is done. This way, the packaged code is decoupled from node.js and can be copied to run on any machine without having to install vue and nodejs.

![build](FinalReport-Pictures/Deployment/1.png)

Here, another computer is simulated as a WSL virtual machine. The frontends are deployed by first installing the Nginx library and then starting the Nginx server by binding a network port (e.g., localhost:9000) to the dist folder path.

![deployment1](FinalReport-Pictures/Deployment/2.png)

For the backend, our programs are written on python's Flask server. However, Flask is intended for development only, so it should be deployed with a WSGI interface. As a result, the server can run automatically and sleep processes when there are no user requests to reduce power consumption.

![deployment2](FinalReport-Pictures/Deployment/3.png)

The reason why we adopt the separation of front and back ends is mainly because the requirements of front and back ends are different. Our front-end packaging and deployment has addressed the issues of time-consuming, error-prone, copy-controlled vue and nodejs; Backend applications need to access the database and can't run without data, so packaging a copy of the database is a very insecure behavior and should not be packaged with the frontend.

3. A proof of successful containerization.

The running results of the program after packaging and deployment are as follows. The UI and various functions are completely the same as without packaging and deployment.
